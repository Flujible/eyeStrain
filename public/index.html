        <h2>Eye Strain</h2>
        <p>Staring at a screen for too long is bad for your eyes so its important to take regular breaks.</p>
        <p>One strategy to help reduce eye strain is to use the 20-20-20 rule developed by Californian optometrist Jeffrey Anshel.</p>
        <p>The rule states that for every 20 minutes spent using a digital screen users should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.</p>
        <p>This site will help you to adhere to this rule by giving you a desktop notification every 20 minutes. 
            On top of this, every hour you'll be prompted to take a slightly longer break where you should stretch your legs, as being sedentary for too long is also bad!</p>
        <p>As long as this webpage is open on your computer you'll recieve the notifications and improve your optical health.</p>
