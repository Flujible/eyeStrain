# Eye strain

This is the repo for [Eyestrain](https://eyestrain.netlify.app/m), a site designed to try and keep your eyes healthy while you work.

Staring at a screen for too long is bad for your eyes so its important to take regular breaks.

One strategy to help reduce eye strain is to use the 20-20-20 rule developed by Californian optometrist Jeffrey Anshel.

The rule states that for every 20 minutes spent using a digital screen users should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

This site will help you to adhere to this rule by giving you a desktop notification every 20 minutes. On top of this, every hour you'll be prompted to take a slightly longer break where you should stretch your legs, as being sedentary for too long is also bad!

As long as this webpage is open on your computer you'll recieve the notifications or a visual cue to look away so you can improve your optical health.
